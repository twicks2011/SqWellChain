****Instructions for using the scripts for creating/updating conditional probability distributions***

The new scripts are "updateConfigDist.c", with its executable "updateConfigDist" and "resetNames.sh". Copy these scripts either to ~/bin or to the working directory where you intend to use them.

The script "updateConfigDist.c" takes a list of configuration files as input, then updates a distribution of Steinhardt-Nelson order parameters. 

If "configuration.dat" does not already exist within the current working directory, it will be created.

Once a configuration file has been used to update a distribution, its file name is prefixed with "DONE".

To reset the filenames, run "resetNames.sh" in the working directory.
